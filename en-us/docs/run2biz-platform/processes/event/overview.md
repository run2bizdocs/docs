lifecycle. The event management is one of the main operation activities of the
IT".

The event is defined as "A state change that has significance for the management
of a configuration item or IT service. Event is also the term used for when an
alert or notification is created by any IT service, configuration item, or
monitoring tool. Events often require action from the IT operations team and can
sometimes lead to incident generation and registration."
