Title: Overview

# Overview

Natively, the following types of platform authentication are possible: local, LDAP / AD, SSO, and Okta.

- **Local**: this is the standard method of accessing the platform, where users are registered in the tool database.

- **LDAP/AD**: the authentication is the most common form of access to the platform and is geared towards the end customer scenario. It allows you to authenticate to the system without the need to create users manually.

- **Sing Single On - SSO**: this is an alternative to automatic login on the platform. However, it's necessary to have an infrastructure oriented to this service.

- **Okta**: with this method it is possible to use an available user base in Okta and use it for authentication in a 4biz instance.
