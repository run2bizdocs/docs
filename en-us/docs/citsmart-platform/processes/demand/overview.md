Presentation

According to ITIL "The process responsible for understanding, forecasting and
influencing client demand for services. Demand management works with capacity
management to ensure that the service provider has sufficient capacity to attend
the demand. At a strategic level, demand management can involve analysis of
business activity patterns and user profiles, while at the tactical level, it
may involve the use of differentiated charges to encourage clients to use IT
services at less busy schedules or require short-term activities to respond to
unexpected demand or failure of a configuration item".
