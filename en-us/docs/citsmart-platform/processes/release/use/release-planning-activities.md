# Activities of the release planning phase

This functionality allows to plan the activities to be executed with the release.

Before getting started
--------------------------

Planning activities occur after the Release has been registered, so check 
to see if there is a Release and if you are allowed to create/execute activities.

Procedure
-------------

1.  Access the functionality through the main menu Processes \> Release
    Management \> Release;

2.  Find the release you want to Plan, click on the button “Open” and
    then on "Release Planning";

3.  We can create a Kanban to manage the activities registered. Click on "+
    Workspace" (available in the area called "Activities") and complete the data
    available, for example, the title, its phase (to be done, in progress,
    etc.), select the user or group responsible for the execution of tasks and
    others;

4.  It is possible to link the roles and responsibilities, projects, notes, 
    documents and system notifications to the release. To do so, it is necessary to 
    click on the available frame, select the item you want to link it to the release. 
    Also, it is possible to link the release to a Kanban already created;

    !!! Abstract "NOTE"
    
        When linking an existing Kanban, if the user does not have permission to access 
        a particular Workspace, the system will display a message informing it. The user 
        must then request permission in Workspace and Sprint or create a new Kanban framework.

5.  In addition to allowing the link of responsibilities, projects, and
    notification of systems, it's possible to create from scratch to fit the
    release in thesis, by clicking on the "Register" button and complete the
    required fields.

What to do next
-------------------

It's necessary to register the information about "release implementation".
