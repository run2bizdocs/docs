Title: Implementing Event Monitor

# Implementing Event Monitor

Event Monitor - EVM - is a module that aims to be an intermediary between CITSmart and client solutions (eg. Nagios, CITSmart Inventory), serving as a repository of event information, generated by monitoring tools or inventory process.

To enable it in a CITSmart instance it is necessary to download the WAR package and perform deploy on the Wildfly application server, which can be the same as the CITSmart. It is important to note that EVM should be available on a port other than the CITSmart application. We remember that the EVM does not have its own interface because management is done via the CITSmart application.

## Procedure

1. Download the war package from the EVM component;  
2. Unpack the files;  
3. Copy the package to the deployment folder of the Wildfly application server;  
4. Configure [System Properties][2] with Mongo access data and the CITSmart instance;  

## What to do next

To test the EVM, [configure][1] the connections in the CITSmart instance.
