# BUILDER 

## Overview 

Builder is an application development platform fully integrated with 4Biz that provides a fast and reliable way to adapt the organization IT management environment to the changes in operational processes and business needs.

Built based on mature Web development technologies, on the concepts of dynamic application & hot deploy, where there is no need to restart the server or system, and out of the box  integration with the Service Management structure (SLAs, knowledge, portfolio, tickets, services portal), Builder offers different possibilities for improvement and expansion of the 4Biz environment, from codeless CRUDs to complex integrations with legacy or third-party systems.


## Why adopt it?Â 


Application development can often be time consuming and expensive, as well as exposing the business to high risk. Builder uses an intelligent dynamic for automating business processes and building user interfaces (UI) with drag and drop features, where you can drag predefined elements to create the UI visuals in a flexible, safe and quick way.

With a high interoperability level, Builder provides a REST interface that enables simple and secure access to legacy applications that were developed not having the Web in consideration.
