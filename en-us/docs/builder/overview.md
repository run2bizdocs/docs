Application development can often be time-consuming and expensive, as well as
exposing a high risk to the business. CITSmart Neuro presents intelligent
dynamics of business process automation and drag and drop screen construction,
meaning you can drag pre-defined elements to create the screens in a flexible,
secure and agile way. In addition, it has a very high level of interoperability,
allowing you to integrate your new application with any other legacy system. As
the business rules of these applications change constantly in
organizations/systems, the solution is prepared to work with the dynamism that
the business demands, these business rules are created in a practical way and
can be reused, avoiding waste.
