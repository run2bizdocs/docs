## Characteristics

- Each Form can contain one or more form pages where each page has HTML code, an AngularJS controller and a collection of dependencies;

- The screen layout is common to all form pages and it is built by dragging and dropping UI components;

- The screen layout, drawn on the Design tab of the screen, contains a collection of lines where each line can have one or more user interface components;

- Form Pages available in the system:

    - **CRUD page** - Page automatically configured by the system during the creation of the Business Object that provides the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality to the Business Object;

    - **Default page** - Page used to provide user data during a 4Biz Service Management service request creation;

    - **Process page** - Page used to start a Builder Business Process;

    - **Task page **- Page to render a Builder form on the ticket screen of a 4Biz Tracker Workflow;
