![Neuro Elements][1]

In a simple way we can define the interaction between elements as: 

1. Business Object, the open door to data, making possible the usage of REST APIÂ´s, filtering and acting with the database using Domains and Business Rules 

2. Forms are the way of interface and interact with Business Objects and the resources can enrich the interface with UX or else logic and programming. 

3. Forms will connect with SM Flows and ESI Flow, interfacing with systems and databases
