# Service Integration Flow   

Service integration flows, as the name implies, involve workflows that are executed based on system services, such as integrations and conversions, for example.  

## How to access  

1. Access the functionality through the menu Neuro > Management > Integration Flow.  

## Preconditions  

1. Not applicable  

## Filters  

1. The following filter enables the user to restrict the participation of items in the standard feature listing, making it easier to find the desired items:  

    * Keyword

## Items list  

1. The following cadastral fields are available to the user to make it easier to identify the desired items in the standard feature listing: **Name, Description, Flow Application, Version**, and **Block date**.

## Filling in the registration fields - flow data 

Through this tab, all basic information about the flow to be design is defined.  

1. To add a new flow, click New > Integration services flow, as shown in the figure below:

2. To add a new flow data, click Add.  
3. The following screen will be displayed:

4. Enter a **name** for the flow, a **description**, which **form** will start the flow (if applicable), and whether or not flow execution will persist. If the field **"Keep running the stream"** is checked, Neuro will persist in the database on every instance of the execution of this flow.  

5. The field **version** is incremented automatically by the system whenever a new version of the workflow is created.  

## Variables  

In this tab are configured the variables that will be used in the drawn flow. Variables are objects that can hold and represent a value or expression. Variables are associated with "names", called identifiers, during the runtime of the flow.  

1. To add a new variables, choose the tab for the same and then click "Add".  
2. The following screen will be displayed:

3. Fill in the fields:  

    - Variable's name;  
    - Description;  
    - Whether it will be stored in the database;  
	    - This option will store the value of the variable internally within the **Neuro** data model, so it will retain the value                 during the execution of the tasks  
    - Whether it is a return variable;  
	    - This option will cause **Neuro** to return the variable at the end of the flow run.  
    - Whether it is a values list;  
    - If it is an input variable in the flow interface;  
	    - This option allows the variable to be "injected" into the business process linked to this flow.  
    - If it is an output variable in the flow interface;  
	    - This option causes the variable to have the value filled when the business process bound to the flow is executed.  
    - The variable type;  
	    - If it is a Java object, enter the corresponding Java class;  
	    - If it is a business object, inform what its respective application is and what the registered name of the business object;  
    - The initial value of the variable, whether constant or script.  
	    - If the value is a constant, it will never be changed during the flow execution, regardless of the operations performed by             the user.  

4. To edit a variable, select the desired variable, click "Edit", make the necessary changes, and click Update to complete the edit.  

5. To remove a variable flow, select the desired variable, click "Remove", and confirm the deletion.

    To save the changes effectively, click "Save" on the top bar. 

## Actions 

Through this menu, it is possible to register the actions that will be run in the workflow.  

The actions are based on scripts programmed in **Rhino** language.  

 1. To include an action, choose the tab for the same and then click go to "Add".  
 2. The following screen will be displayed:

3. Fill in the fields:  

    - an **identifier** for the action;  
    - the literal **name** for the action;  
    - and the **script** that will be run when the action is triggered.  

4. To edit an action, select the action you want, click "Edit", make the necessary changes, and click "Update" to complete the edit.  

5. To remove an action, select the action, click "Remove", and confirm the deletion.

    To save the changes effectively, click "Save" on the top bar. 

## Diagram  

The diagram of a service flow does not have the same **"Task"** components as a process flow. I.e., you cannot use the **"Human Task"** components for **"Sub Process Workflow"**.  

For a business process, we have, in addition, these components sections:  

- **Connectors**: components used to perform operations related to the database.  
- **Components**: varied components for performing various tasks.  
- **Transformers**: components for converting variable types.  
- **CITSmart**: components used for integration with an external Citsmart system.  

The other components present in the palette resemble the components of a "Process Flow". Further information regarding the functionality and use of each of the components can be found in the Developing Applications.
