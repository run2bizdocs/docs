      Angular Controller JS, and a collection of dependencies (Screen layout is
      common to all pages)

      screen design may have one or more components (with one or more properties)

   * Pages previously configured in the system:

   -  **Default page**

       * Page used to start SM service, search the data inside database and register
          directly on it.

   -  **CRUD page**

       * Page automatically created by the business Object, with the basic functions

   -  **Process page**

       * Page for SM system processes associated with business processes, used to
         Start a Neuro Business Process.

   -  **Task page**

       * Run through a created Workflow/ESI Design, rendering a neuro form on the
         ticket screen.

The components are arranged in rows and columns, and the rows have a width of 12 columns. This means that in each line you can insert up to 2 components with width 6, or up to 3 components with width 4, for example. It is not mandatory to fill the entire row;
