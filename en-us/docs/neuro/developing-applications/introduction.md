    The steps can be found in the CITSmart documentation (docs.citsmart.com).

## Design App


For a better development of Neuro applications, it is good practice a previous
**design of needs and requirements that the application will meet**, also
include the **entities model** of the data that will travel through the
application,

A research of the **desired interfaces** and, if the Neuro will be the option to
use data for services, the **design of the services** that will be automated.

## Neuro Configuration


After Designs the Application gathering the information regarding the data
entities of your Neuro Application you will:

1.  Create your *DATABASE CONNECTION* and your *NEURO APPLICATION* entry;

2.  Verify if you will be going to use any common *DOMAIN* for your installation
    and create if it´s necessary;

3.  You will, also, verify the *BUSINESS RULES* for the registration, update or
    deletion of records in the data entity… you will link those to the Business
    Object;

4.  If you will have forms that will use multiple languages you will create the
    *INTERNATIONALIZATION KEYS*, labels that will be used for all fields in your
    forms.

## Neuro Development


The configuration step will make us ready to develop the application:

1.  Create the *BUSINESS OBJECTS*, containing the data structure of the entity,
    at this step you will be able to create the columns, PK´s and FK´s (assign
    relationships), link Business rules and Domains you will be able to create
    CRUD forms and other features;

2.  Create *FORMS* related to your Business.

## CITSmart Experience Connection


After you have your Business Objects and Forms created you can:

1.  *LINK THE FORM TO A SERVICE* as needed, or

2.  *LINK THE FORM TO CITSmart Experience MENU OR TO AN EXPERIENCE CENTER*, this will make you
    able to maintain tables and additional data that will be not used on a ticket opening.
