# Register release
According to ITIL, release is "one or more changes to an IT service that are built, tested and deployed together. A single release may include changes to hardware, software, documentation, processes and other components".
This functionality makes available several actions, like, include, change and delete a release.

Before getting started
--------------------------

The Release is part of the Change process, so it is necessary to have a
registered RFC (request for change). To register a release, it's
necessary to have previously registered the release portfolio, the employee,
contract, unit linked to the contract, executor group linked to the contract,
type of release and periodic activity group.

Procedure
-------------

1.  Access the functionality through the main menu Processes \> Release
    Management \> Release;

2.  Click on the options button “Operations” and then on "Register";

3.  Complete the fields available in the areas: requester and request.

4.  It's also necessary to indicate the initial release planning and deployment
    information. In the "Other information" tab of each phase, assign the
    beginning and end date and time of each one of them;

5.  Click on the options button “Operations” and then on "Save".
