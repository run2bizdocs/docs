# Overview

Presentation

Release is defined as a significant change in the organization's IT
infrastructure, which may be the introduction of new CIs, or the updating of the
current ones.

The Release Management process provides the physical management of software and
hardware, allowing the planning of the releases to be carried out in the IT
infrastructure, based on information about CIs and their relationships stored in
