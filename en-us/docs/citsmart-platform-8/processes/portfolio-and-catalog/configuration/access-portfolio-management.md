# Define the permission to access Portfolio Management functionalities

ITIL recommends that an ITSM product should be able to assign specific levels of
responsibilities to a Portfolio Manager or others, based on this recommendation,
CITSmart adopts this differentiated form of permissions control, per module. It
is worth mentioning that the 'Access Profile' functionality continues to exist
and it controls all types of access without the separation by modules, so that
the product administrator can intervene more properly whenever necessary.

The functionality Portfolio Management defines who will have access to the
Service Portfolio Management and which type of access is allowed (view, save
and/or delete).
