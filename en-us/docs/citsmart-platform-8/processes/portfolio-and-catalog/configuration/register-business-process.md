# Register business process

The Business Process will help to the delivery of a product or a service to the clients. For example: a trader may have a buying process that helps him/her deliver services to their clients. Many business processes rely on IT services.
This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and deleting a business process.

    !!! Abstract "NOTE"

        Vital function is a part of a business process that is critical to
        business success, ie it is the part of running the business that can not
        stop. Imagine, for example, software that takes care of the process of an
        automatic teller machine for cash withdrawals: the function of issuing
        banknotes for the customer will probably have a greater criticality than the
        function of issuing extracts. Therefore, the former is more likely to be
        considered a vital function. Vital role is an important consideration in
        managing service continuity.  

3.  Click on "Save".
