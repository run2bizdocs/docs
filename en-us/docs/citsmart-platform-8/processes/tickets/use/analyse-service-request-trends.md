# Analyze service request trends  
This functionality aims to make an analysis of the requests, based on the critical amount, to identify which items will influence on the launch of a new request.

To make the trend analysis, it's necessary to previously register a service
request (ticket) linked to a contract, in addition to an active contract.

Procedure

    Analysis, the tab **Service Requests**;

2.  Complete all mandatory fields;

3.  Click on "Search";

4.  Each tab will display the results for each type (Service, Cause and
    Configuration Item) and in each item two buttons will be displayed; one
    to **Create Chart** of Trend Analysis, which shows the dates that comprise
    the reported period and the number of occurrences on that date; and another
    for Create Problem, where the problem registration screen will be
    displayed to save the necessary information of the problem:

    -   When you choose to register a problem from the **Service**, the problem
    registration screen will be displayed with the "Description" field completed
    with the name of the corresponding service;

    -   When you choose to register a problem from the **Cause**, the problem
