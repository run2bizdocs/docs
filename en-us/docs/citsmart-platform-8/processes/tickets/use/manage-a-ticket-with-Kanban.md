# Manage team with Kanban
This option allows to help managers in the detail monitoring of the tickets attendance list, using the management technique called Kanban. Kanban uses cards (post-it and others) to indicate the attendance of production flows.
In these cards, indications are given about a certain task, for example: "to execute" / "in execution" / "done", and whenever the flow advances its positioning changes to the right in the frame.

Before getting started
--------------------------

To movement the Kanban, it's necessary to have at least one ticket registered,
in addition to have an access profile with such permission.

Procedure
-------------

1.  Access the functionality Ticket Management through the main menu Processes
    \> Request and Incident Management \> Service Request and Incident;

2.  Click on the ticket view in the Attendant mode, through the button "Per attendant";

3.  Filter the cards view;

4.  Manage the cards.
