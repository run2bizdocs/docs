According to ITIL, the capacity can be defined as "The maximum throughput that a
configuration item or IT service can deliver. For some types of CIs, the
capacity may be the size or the volume - for example, a disk drive".

The capacity management can be defined as "The process responsible for ensuring
that IT service capabilities and IT infrastructure are able to meet agreed
capacity and performance requirements in a timely and cost effective manner.
Capacity management considers all the resources needed to deliver an IT service
and addresses the attendance of current and future capacity and performance
needs of the business".
