# Refine search in Knowledge Portal

This knowledge aims to guide and suggest the best ways of search in the Knowledge Portal.

1.  Connectors between terms (Boolean logical operator):

    + AND (+): it's possible to search with more than one word, prioritizing one
    of them in the result. Adding the positive sign "+" in front of the word,
    it'll be prioritized, for example: ticket +delegate;

    + NOT (-): it's possible to refine (reduce) the result, including words to be
    excluded of the list. E.g.: Request -Incident.

1.  Vary how to write a word, for example:

    + Request

    + Requesting

    + It's possible to search for a part of the word: Reque

1.  Use synonyms:

    + Generate

    + Create

1.  Search for the exactly phrase:

    + Put the phrase you want with commas, e.g.: "How to delegate a ticket"

1.  Navigate through the folders and click in one with the subject you want.
