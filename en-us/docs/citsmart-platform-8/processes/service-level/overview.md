# Overview

Presentation
----------------

The Service Level Management is a process responsible to maintain, improve and
deliver the quality expected by the business, through agreements, contracts,
measuring the performance, justifying the costs related to the business. The
process also assures that the current and planned IT services will be delivered
with tangible results. This can be done through a constant cycle of negotiation,
agreement, monitoring, reporting and revision of goals and results by means of
action to correct and improve the service level delivered.
