# Instalation overview

These steps will help you install Citsmart in on-premises environments. Before starting, it is important to keep in mind the software required for the installation of the platform, as well as its functionality. The Citsmart platform is composed of the following sets of software:

* **CITSmart Enterprise Platform**: Platform package in java WAR (web application ARchive) format.
* **Wildfly**: Java EE Web application server.
* **SOLR**: Platform written in Java maintained by Apache used for searches.
* **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing non-relational objects.
* **Active MQ**: Java message queue service developed and maintained by Apache.
* **Guacamole/GUACD**: Apache Guacamole is a clientless remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP and SSH.
* **Tika**: Apache Tika is a toolkit that detects and extracts metadata and text from different types of file formats (such as PPT, XLS and PDF).

!!! warning
     Not all platform installations require Guacamole, only those that require remote access to the stations are made from CITSmart. The rest of the tools are required in all facilities for proper platform operation.
