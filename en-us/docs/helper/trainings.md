# Training

**What does it mean to train my virtual assistant?**

It's the act of placing your assistant to understand how the interactions with the user will be, considering the dialogs constructed. Whenever new interactions are added, the assistant must be retrained so it can react as expected in a conversation.

The only prerequisite for scheduling your virtual assistant training is to have at least one dialogue built.

## Scheduling training

**Procedure**

1.  After access the platform, go to the menu "Training";

2.  Click on "Schedule";

3.  Define the scope of the update you want, with the following options: Dialogues, Complete, Skills (Text - Button - Image) or Custom skills;

4.  Inform the day and time for the training to be performed.

    > Observation: Remember to choose dates and times that will have less impact on ongoing calls, if there is any.

!!! note "Information"

    The duration of each training will vary according to the volume of conversation flows built, but don't worry, as soon as it's completed, your assistant is automatically ready to act, either in the conversation test within the platform or in the production environment.
