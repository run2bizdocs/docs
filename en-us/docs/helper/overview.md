# Overview

## What's Helper

Helper is the 4biz Artificial Intelligence platform. The first feature available was a virtual assistant, the Helper Assistant, a chatbot that communicates and interacts with people through automated text messages. 

Helper uses artificial intelligence to conduct dialogues with increasingly improved users on different platforms and, in addition to interacting with users, is able to integrate with other systems to get answers to questions, retrieving data through APIs.

## Helper Operation

Helper uses 5 main concepts in its operation:

* Build: through its interface, it is possible to create conversation flow examples (dialogues) so it can learn how to react to user interactions;

* Train: after creating the dialogue examples, it is possible to train the Helper so it will consider the examples given in their interactions. Unlike most solutions, Helper uses artificial intelligence to understand what the user meant, so it is not necessary for the user to type exactly the same sentence that was given as an example;

* Code: It is possible to connect Helper with external APIs, allowing data access necessary to deliver value to the user;

* Connect: It is possible to integrate Helper to different messaging platforms, natively, it can already be integrated with Facebook and 4biz;

* Monitor: Once it is made available to the user, it is possible to follow the conversations made by Helper, in order to improve the training information and gain insight into new dialogues to be taught to Helper.
