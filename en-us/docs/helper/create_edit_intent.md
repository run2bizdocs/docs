Title: Intents

# Intents

Intents, in the chatbot language, means the **interests or intentions** of the user when interacting with artificial intelligence. That means, knowing exactly what that user's phrase or message means. Intents are important because they determine the ability of the virtual assistant to analyze the intention of whoever is using it, resulting in the understanding and success of the conversation.

Within the Helper tool, intents are a set of phrases or terms linked to an identification, that is, we'll group in a block the phrases and interactions that would be used by the user for a given theme and identification.

For example, for the subject “Greetings”, register phrases that are related to the intention of greetings, something like “Good morning”, “Hello”, “Hi”, and others.

The themes and identifications will depend on the needs of your company, so everything that is registered for training and understanding of the virtual assistant will be related to the reality of the services offered in your organization.

## Procedure

1.  After access the platform, go to the menu “Intents”;

2.  First, the following options will be presented on the screen:

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
| New   | To create a new intent.|
| Search | To search for a intent already registered.|
| List  | List with all intents in your assistant. You have two options for each intent in the list: Edit and Delete.|

3\.  To view or edit an already registered intent, search for a specific one or search in the list presented;

4\.  To create a new intent, click on “New” and complete the information as needed:

|Field|Description|
|-|-|
| Name   | To identify the general tenor of the user's subject. It'll be the name for the phrase block that the user can use for a given context. For example, “Greetings”, “User requests to send the conversation by email”, and others.|
| Theme   | Depending on the type of attendance and services that the assistant will perform, the themes will classify the type of conversation for the intent that will be created. For example, “small talk” for greetings; “Service standards” for when the user requests an email conversation, etc.|
| Phrases | Register the phrases that can be used by the user for the subject of the intent being created. It's important to register the maximum number of sentences related to the subject so that the assistant's accuracy is better. For example, for a set of intent on "Greetings", we could register phrases such as "Good morning", "Hello", "Hey", among many others. After entering the desired phrase, click on "Add".|

5\.  After add the phrases for the intent, it'll be presented the following options:

|Field|Description|

| Link context | A opção de vincular contexto é utilizada para cadastrar sinônimos a uma determinada frase. Por exemplo, na saudação “Bom dia”, podemos vincular um contexto de saudações, onde para “Bom dia” teremos os sinônimos “Boa tarde” e “Boa noite”. Ou seja, podemos aprimorar ainda mais os acertos da assistente virtual ao vincularmos mais contextos para uma frase. Ao clicar em vincular contexto, aparecerão as opções “Contexto” e “para o texto”, onde iremos procurar pelo contexto correspondente já cadastrado na ferramenta e depois colocaremos as frases sinônimas da que será utilizada nessa intent.|
