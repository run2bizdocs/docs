Title: Context

# Context

**Definition**

The dialogues are immersed in contexts. Equal words can have different meanings depending on the context in which they are inserted.

To increase accuracy in homonymous situations and avoid repetition of phrases due to synonyms, it's possible to register a context base for the virtual assistant to distinguish homonyms and the correlation between synonyms to make the conversation more fluid.
