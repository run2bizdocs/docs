Title: What is Helper

# What is Helper?

It's the first resource made available by Run2biz of artificial intelligence. Helper is a virtual assistant, a chatbot that communicates and interacts with people through automated text messages.

Helper uses artificial intelligence to dialog with users in an increasingly improved way on different platforms, in addition to interacting with users and able to integrate with other systems to obtain answers to questions, recovering data through API.

## Helper Functionalities

It meets the 5 main concepts of virtual assistant construction platforms:

**- Build:** Building the assistant's conversation flows (dialogs) with possible human interactions, so that it's prepared to react and respond fluidly and correctly;

**- Train:** Assistant training to consider all examples of builded dialogs and their interactions. Helper uses artificial intelligence to understand what the user wanted to say or request, so when building dialogs it's not necessary to write exactly what a user will say to it;

**- Code:** Possibility of connection with external API, which allow access of data needed for responses;

**- Connect:** Possibility of integration with several communication channels (ready-made platforms or customized channels). Helper provides easily connectable API and a conversion within 4biz so that the choices (whether on buttons or not) reach Helper as text, thus giving the correct treatment in the dialog flow. We offer integration with the smartchat of the 4biz platform and Facebook, the other most used channels, such as Twitter and Whatsapp can be integrated through 4biz;

**- Monitor:** Monitoring that provides the Helper administration manager with data for analysis of how the assistant has been behaving, frequently asked questions, most used answers, among other information so that existing flows can be improved or noted the need to build new flows and new training for the assistant.

## Accessing Helper

After releasing the Helper environment, access the configuration instance through the link provided, for example: http://[server-name].helperassistant.com.

In this environment, it's possible to add and review knowledge for the Helper, schedule training, monitor the interactions performed by Helper and perform interaction tests to validate whether interactions are being effective.
