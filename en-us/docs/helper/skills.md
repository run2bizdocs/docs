Title: Skills

# Skills

The skills within the virtual assistant have the functionality of possible responses from the chatbot to the interactions with the user, which can be an error using fallback or even a pre-defined ability to respond to the user.

## Fallback

Fallback is a registered skill in case the virtual assistant cannot understand the user's message or objective, this happens when the user requests something different from the registered contexts.

In this way, the virtual assistant uses some pre-defined phrases by the Helper administrator, which will be sent to the user, for example "I didn't understand that", "I haven't been programmed to answer this yet", "You can reformulate it, I didn't understand what you meant", and others. So your virtual assistant can notify the end user that this order couldn't be performed or understood, showing the user to request something else or define another objective.

## Extended Skill

It happens when a user wants the virtual assistant to perform a skill in addition to the preconfigured ones (text, button, image or custom). Through it, the user requests this new skill to the management team of Helper, who will do what the client requested and give it a name.

## New Skill

1.  After access the platform, go to the menu "Skills". It's possible to manage skills by editing, deleting and creating a skill;

2.  Click on "New" to create a new skill;

3.  Complete the fields as necessary:

|Field| Description|

| Is this a fallback skill?| Select whether the skill is fallback or not.|
| Is this an extended skill?| Select whether this skill is an extended skill or not.|

4\.  Complete the fields on the screen, paying attention to the type of skill:   

**- Standard**: it'll be used to represent skills that are answered through a predefined text response. Several pre-defined response phrases can be assigned, always aiming to answer the same question; 

**- Custom**: it'll be used when, to respond to a user's interest, the Helper needs to search for information in another system.   

**- Button**: it'll be used whenever it's necessary to limit the user's responses to a specific Helper interaction. When using this option, Helper will respond to user interaction by displaying buttons. A button is defined by its Name and Value. In the name field, the button that appears to the user is defined. In the value field, it's defined for the assistant how it should interpret the user's interest when clicking the button; 

**- Image**: It can be used when you want to answer the user using text and image. The image associated with the response will be displayed in the chat window.

5\.  Click on "Save" to finish the registration.
