# How to train Anuva

In the Training screen, it is possible to schedule updates so that your Anuva can interact with the user 
considering the last added knowledge. This functionality allows scheduling the training according to your 
need and can even define recurrence.

Before getting started
--------------

Make sure that there is at least one dialog created.

Procedure
-----------

1. Access the menu “Training”;

2. Click on “Schedule”;

3. Complete the fields available and click on “Save”.



!!! Abstract "NOTE"
    
    The duration of the training will depend on the volume of dialogues registered, but do not worry, 
    once the training is completed, Anuva will be updated automatically. At any time, you can start a 
    conversation with Anuva to check the effectiveness of its interactions by clicking on the floating 
    icon located in the lower right corner of the screen. Remembering that it will reflect the knowledge 
    added until the last training.
