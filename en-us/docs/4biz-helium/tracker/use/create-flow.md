Create workflow
===============

It's possible to create workflows that best fit to the users' reality,
customizing the scenario of each organization.

Procedure
---------

1.  Access the main menu Tracker \> Flow Design;

2.  Click on "New";

3.  In the tab "Flow Data", it's necessary to complete the mandatory data: name
    (its internal identifier, it must be informed without space, accents and
    special characters); the process to which it's linked (the flow will be only
    visible to the process to which it's linked) and the option that allow to
    reopen the service regardless of group settings. It's also possible to view
    the version of the flow.

4.  In the “Diagram” tab, it's presented the tool to design the flow by entering
    elements that represent the scenario. To do so, simply click on the element
    and drag it to the design area. When you do this, a screen will be displayed
    to set the properties. We must take into account that a flow starts with the
    "Start Event" element and ends with the "End Event".

-   !!! Abstract "IMPORTANT"

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The conditional paths of a flow must be defined in the Connection (Sequence Flow). 
    To access these options, click once on the connection and then on the properties icon.
    It's possible to identify the connection (eg. approved) and indicate a Condition, Action or State. [See Build Expression][2].
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  The properties of an element can be defined by double-clicking the element
    and then the icon next to it (properties icon). Define the data for this
    property by entering the required data in each of the property tabs. Here it
    is also liberated to link a knowledge to the "Knowledge Base" tab and
    implement functionalities in the flow on the activity by clicking on the
    "Interface" tab;

-   !!! Abstract "NOTE"

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    The "Interface" tab allows you to choose which interaction mode (form
    standard, questionnaire or builder form) that will be applied to the service. 
    However, if a service request template is not linked to this tab, the system 
    will sub-understand and apply the configurations of a standard form, enabled 
    configuration item link, change, problem and request related to the ticket in
    ticket management screen.  
    We can also cite another rule referring to this tab: the regulations here
    will have priority over the template service request, as this is a complement 
    to the flow of.  
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1.  Besides, the functionality allows to import flows when click on "Import".
    It'll be possible to import in "JSON" or "XML".

2.  After define the flow, click on "Save".
