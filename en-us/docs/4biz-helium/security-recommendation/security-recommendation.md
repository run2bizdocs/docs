Title: Safety recommendations
Description: It describes the safety recommendations

# Safety recommendations

For greater safety of your operating environment, we recommend:

1. The use of external authenticators, for example, LDAP or OAuth2 servers. If your business does not have it, there are several OAuth2 standard security servers in cloud providers that can easily be integrated into the platform.

2. Avoid using local platform users. The security team detected in different versions of the platform, functionality non-compliance with international safety standards. Therefore, we recommend not using it. It will be discontinued in the next versions, and as described in item 1, there are fast, accessible, and safer alternatives to replace this feature.

3. Aligned to item 2, we recommend that after initial settings, all local users be removed from the platform. If there are any questions in this process, please activate the support channels.

4. We recommend the use of Captcha for facilities where there is access or visibility by the large external public, for example, citizens. This functionality can be activated through platform settings. 

5. Set up an alert email for when you exceed the maximum number of failed authentication attempts on the platform. This functionality can be activated through platform settings.

6. For on-premises operating environments, i.e., hosted in customer responsibility facilities, we recommend using intrusion detection solutions. These solutions contribute to the safety of the operational environment as a whole. They are external to the platform, need to be acquired, implemented, and maintained by the customer.

7. Still, for on-premises operating environments, we recommend that all infrastructure components that support the platform, including the database server and the application server, have regular password change routines.

8. We request that any identified security fragility situation be immediately referred to our support team or one of our authorized partners. Under no circumstances, make any kind of statement before proper analysis by the manufacturerâ€™s security team, as such situations may be part of the existing recommendations package or be a situation related to double or additional protections.
