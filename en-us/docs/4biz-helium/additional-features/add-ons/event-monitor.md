Title: Implementing Event Monitor

# Implementing Event Monitor

Event Monitor - EVM - is a module that aims to be an intermediary between 4biz and client solutions (eg. Nagios, 4biz Inventory), serving as a repository of event information, generated by monitoring tools or inventory process.

To enable it in a 4biz instance it is necessary to download the WAR package and perform deploy on the Wildfly application server, which can be the same as the 4biz. It is important to note that EVM should be available on a port other than the 4biz application. We remember that the EVM does not have its own interface because management is done via the 4biz application.

## Procedure

1. Download the war package from the EVM component;  
2. Unpack the files;  
3. Copy the package to the deployment folder of the Wildfly application server;  
4. Configure [System Properties][2] with Mongo access data and the 4biz instance;  

## What to do next

To test the EVM, [configure][1] the connections in the 4biz instance.
