Description: We will present the existing filters on the app's ticket screen.

# Filters - All tickets

After starting the Racer 4Biz app, we can access the Tickets screen, and, next to it, we have 3 options to visualize the tickets: My Tickets - where it is possible to perform actions on tickets opened by yourself; All - where the agent has access to tickets they have to solve; Approve - where profiles with approval permissions can do their work.

On this document, we will cover all the available tickets to the agent under the option All, where they can see all the tickets waiting to be solved.
