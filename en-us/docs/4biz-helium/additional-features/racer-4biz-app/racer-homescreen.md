# Homescreen of Racer 4biz App

Racer is the mobile app of 4biz, designed to make the visualization of tickets and services easier, and to make it possible to follow the steps of the services from anywhere, using your mobile.
Let's start by getting to know the homescreen a little better.

## Before Getting Started

- [x] Instal the app Racer4biz for Android (required version 7.0 and API level 24) or IOS (required version 13.4);  
- [x] Have access credentials to the system.
- [x] Required 4Biz version: 9.2.0.0. 

## Procedure 

After starting the app Racer 4biz, let's perform the first configuration to access the system.

### Change Language

the first configuration is to choose the language to be used on the app.

On the screen "Language Selection", there are 4 options:

|Option|Description|
|-----|---------|
|System Default|The default language of the mobile.|
|English| Changes the language to English|
|Spanish| Changes the language to Spanish|
|Brazilian Portuguese|Changes the language to Brazilian Portuguese|

!!! note "NOTE"

    If your mobile has a default language other than these 3, the system will automatically pick English as default.
    
There is an arrow at the beggining of the screen to go back to the previous screen.

### Select conection

Let's select the conection we will use to access the app. To do this, click "Conection". If you still do not have a conection, the screen will show the button "Add Conection". Click it to create a new one. The following fields will be shown:

|Field|Description|
|-----|---------|
|Conection Name| Type in the desired name for your conection|
|Conection URL|Field to inform the URL of the conection. It should look like URL/ context name. Example: http://<span></span>example.clou4biz.com/4biz|
|Checkbox "Default conection"|Checkbox to inform if you wish this conection to be your default. If you choose to do so, a message will pop asking "Are you sure you want to change the default conection?", and you can confirm or cancel the operation. If you do not check the box, the message will not show.|

After saving your conection, you will be taken to the "Select Conection" screen, where you can see the conections you created on a list.

!!!note "NOTE"

     If you have only one registered conection, it will be set as the default conection of the app and it will be displayed on the field "Default conection".
     
If you wish to create more conections, click the "+" symbol and fill in the same fields informed above.  
To edit or delete an existing conection, click the ... beside the conection and select "Edit Conection" or "Delete Conection".

## Session start

To start a session, we need to select the desired conection to access the system, which can be the default one or any other that you registered.

Then, in "User", click it to insert the required information to log in:

1. If the user is in the domain, the login will be registered on the app;  
2. IF the user is not in the domain, the login will be registered on the app along with the domain. For example: example.com/login  

In "password", you must inform the password for that user. You can click the eye icon to view the passowrd or hide it.  

The button "Available for service", you can enable it to share your location. This option is used to inform managers that a user is avaible for service.
