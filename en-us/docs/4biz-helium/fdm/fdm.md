# Fast Deployment Methodology (FDM)

## What is FDM?

Fast Deployment Methodology (FDM) is a methodology created by Run2biz to enable a fast implementation of 4biz. The FDM was developed using framework techniques such as Agile and SCRUM, as well as the practical experience of our specialists and from many lessons learned.

FDM is based on 2 information models. The first model, called the Data Discovery Model, guides the technicians and analysts involved in the implementation of 4biz in a sequence of tables and steps that will take them from the most basic information known, to the organizational details of the services.

The second model, called Product Implementation Model, organizes the relationship of the information discovered in the construction of the first model so that through succession of configurations, 4biz is ready to be used.

The methodology is constantly revised, considering the results obtained at the end of the projects, to ensure its efficiency, effectiveness and practicality. 

Run2biz offers training in FDM methodology to its clients and partners through its training platform (https://training.run2biz.com/en-us/index.html).
