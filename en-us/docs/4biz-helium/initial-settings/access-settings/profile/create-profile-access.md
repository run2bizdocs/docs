title: Create profile access
Description: Defines which rights and permissions the user have in the system.

# Access Profile

The access profile organizes user's rights and permissions in the system, particularly the authorization to search for records or to record and delete information.

After authenticating the user, the access definition process consults the permissions and rights related to the user's access profile. Thus, it defines what can or cannot be done in the system.

It is possible to perform different actions, such as adding, changing and deleting an access profile.

## Procedure

2. Insert the name of the new profile or search for an existing one, in the search tab;

3. To include the permission in the user profile, select the available action fields (Search, Save and Delete) for each feature presented. Note that permissions can be associated with more specific levels of some functionality. To do this, click on the + sign to access more specific items;
