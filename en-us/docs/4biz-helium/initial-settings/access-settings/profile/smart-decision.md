Description: Is intended to allow the Smart Decision access permission to set who will have access to the widgets to insert in the dashboard.

# Define smart decision access permission

Widgets are components that can be included and used in different areas of 4biz. They are usually used to simplify actions or present information.

As the information presented by a Widget can be sensitive or exclusive to certain user groups, permission to be included in Smart Decisions panels can be assigned or denied to the user groups individually.

By default, only user groups explicitly indicated will be allowed to use a specific Widget. Thus, when linking a user group, access will be allowed.

**Procedure**

1.	Access the configuration through the Navigation Menu> Access and Permission> Smart Decisions;

2.	Select the Widget you want to set the permission for and click "Edit";

3.	Click on the "Link group" button;

4.	Search and select the desired group and click on "Send" to link;

5.	Click "Save" to conclude.
