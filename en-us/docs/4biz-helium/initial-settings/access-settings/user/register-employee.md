# Employee registration

Actions at 4biz always involve the participation of one or more individuals. Their employee registration must be previously done for them to interact with the platform and with each other.

So, before having a ticket registered, a service completed or access granted, everyone must have their data registered in 4biz. Data and registrations can be included, changed or deleted, reflecting the person's situation before the organization.

Note that every user must first be registered as an employee.


## Before getting started

- [X] To register an employee, it is mandatory to designate a unit and a position. If necessary, it is possible to register units and positions from the employee registration form itself.

**Procedure**

1. Access the functionality through the Navigation Menu> General Records> Personnel Management> Employee;

2. Click on the Employee Registration tab to add a new employee or on the Search Employee tab to search for an already registered one. It is possible to search by the name, the taxpayers' registry number or by the employee's register situation, that is, whether it is active or inactive.

3. Fill in the form fields with proper data or change the previously registered data.

4. Then click on “Save” to save the data and finish.
You can also use the “Delete” button to exclude the employee's register. Additionally, use the “Clear” button to clear all values filled in the form.
