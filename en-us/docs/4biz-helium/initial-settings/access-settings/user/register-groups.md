Description: This functionality registers the groups and links with users, profile, contracts and notification e-mails.

# Creating group

A group is a set of one or more employees with the same related objectives and its functions.

The two most common usages for groups are:

1.	Security/secrecy management of access to various types of registries. Per example: knowledge base folders and service portfolios.

2.	Automatic notification scheduling based on some specific event/situation.

This functionality registers the groups and links with users, profile, contracts and notification e-mails templates. Also, it is possible to change and delete a group.
