Description: Describe the release and update cycles of 4biz Products, clients notifications and other relevant information.

# 4biz Products Release and Update Policy 

## Overview
The purpose of this policy is to describe the release and update cycles for Run2biz Products, client notifications and other relevant information.

The policy guidelines are applicable to all of our products, whether they are using the SaaS or On-Premise model.

## Release and Update Cycles
Our product release and update proposal was designed to provide stability, quick response to problems and a continuous supply of new features and experiences.

4biz products typically follow 4 types of release, as listed below:

|**Type of Release**|**Scope**|**Frequency**|**Notification**|
|-------------------|---------|-------------|----------------|
|Major Version|Recommended for all clients, this update may include new features and killer features. Usually with significant changes in the application or architecture.|Annual|In the month prior to the release, with a second notification 20 days after sending the first one.|
|Stable Release|Recommended for all customers, this update may include new features, improvements, security updates, adjustments and fixes.|Quarterly|In the month prior to the release, with a second notification 10 days before the release.|
|Beta Release|Usually aimed at Beta Users partners and with specific scope. It may include improvements, updates, adjustments and fixes.|Bimonthly|Ten days before the release.|
|Hotfix|Recommended for all clients, this update may include emergency fixes to ensure system stability and security.|Whenever necessary, following authorization and urgency criteria to be defined|A few hours before, preferably 48 hours before.|

(*) The frequency of releases are subject to changes, at Run2biz's sole discretion. In the case of changes to this schedule, clients must be notified in advance.

4biz products use the following standard for version identification:

Version: **Series**
Release: **Stable Release**.**Beta Release**.**Hotfix**

Where: 
- **Series** Identifies the Major Release, for example: Helium.
- **Stable Release** Identifies the related Stable Release 
- **Beta Release** identifies the related Beta Release, or zero when there is no related Beta Release.
- **Hotfix** identifies the related Hotfix, or zero when there is no related Hotfix.

For example:

Helium
Release: 1.2.3 refers to:
- **Series**: Helium.
- **Stable Release**: 1
- **Beta Release**:  2
- **Hotfix**: 3

## Supported Versions
Our current policy is to support the latest version and the previous one.

Run2biz generally performs a major release per year, so the client will need to update approximately once every two years to stay on a supported version. Run2biz provides updates (for example, fixes and hotfixes) only for the supported versions.

## Additional Update Information
The Update Procedures depend on the model of the acquired solution (SaaS or On-Premise), for each one, follow the recommendations below:

### SaaS Clients
Clients can schedule software updates when needed by submitting a new service request through our support website. In this request, the client informs the desired date for updating, the version and type of non-production or production environment). Interruption times are defined to minimize disruption to the client's business. The entire update process is done by the Run2biz support team.

After all tests, the clients must sign the homologation conformity term, ensuring that they have performed all necessary tests and, in this way, authorize the application of the update in production according to the previously scheduled change window. Without this signed document, the update will not be performed.

### On-Premises Clients
In this case, the clients are responsible for updating the software (or through a Run2biz partner hired for this purpose). We recommend the clients to test the functionality and customizations in the non-production environment before upgrading to the production environment. Guidance on how to update or use new features will be available in the Release Notes.

If you have any questions about the update procedures, please send us a service request through our support website.
