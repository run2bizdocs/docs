## Release and Update Cycles
Our release and update cycles approach is designed to provide stability, quick
response to problems and continuous delivery of new features and experiences.

CITSmart products generally follow 3 types of releases, as listed in the
following table:

| **Release Type**     | **Scope**                                                                                                                 | **Frequency**                      | **Notification**                                                                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| *Major Release*        | New application functionalities and killer features for the product.                                                                    | Typically twice a year     | Typically, one month before the release, with a second notification 20 days after sending the first. |
| *Minor Release*        | It includes, but is not limited to minor improvements, security updates, and generally doesn't involve architectural changes. | Typically, once every 2 months |                                                                                                  |
| *Hotfix* **Planned** | Updates including bug and applications fixes, in addition to occasional adjustments.                                                  | Typically, once a month        |                                                                                                  |
| *Hotfix* **Critical**   | Hot fixes needed for system stability or security                                                 | Whenever necessary               | A few hours before, preferably 48 hours before                                                  |


CITSmart refers to each Feature Release, and its associated Hotfixes, as a
"Series". For example, Version 7.6.5.4 is part of Series 7. The series are
version updates, most of the time, with significant changes in the application
or architecture.

Therefore, CITSmart products use the following version standard:

**Series \> Major Release \> Minor Release \> Hotfix**

For example: In version 7.6.5.4, 7 is the Series, 6 is the Major Release, 5 is
the Minor Release and 4 is the HotFix associated.

## Supported Versions

Our current policy is to support the most recent Release Series. The immediately
previous Release Series will be supported up to 6 months after the release of
the new series.

CITSmart generally makes two majors release per year, the client will need to
upgrade approximately once per year to stay on a supported version. CITSmart
provides Updates (e.g.: patches and hotfixes) only for supported version..

## Additional Update Information


Update Procedures depends on the purchased solution model (SaaS or On-Premise),
to each one of them, follow the recommendations below:

**SaaS Clients**

Clients can schedule software updates at their convenience, submitting a new
service request via our support website (itsm.citsmart.com). In this request,
clients define schedule to update, version and environment type (non-production
