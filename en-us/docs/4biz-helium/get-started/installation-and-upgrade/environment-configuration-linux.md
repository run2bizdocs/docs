Description: How to perform the configuration of CITSmart environment on OS Ubuntu.

# Configuration of CITSmart environment using Linux  

It is possible to configure CITSmart with Linus OS. This document present a step-by-step to perform the configuration, starting with the installation of Ubuntu and all required applications and proceeding to the integration process.  


## Before Getting Started  

To start the procedure, it is necessary to download the files from this Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k6f6NtvoAiTwDzQ6trNYHHWo3PSBh0zD  
Use your Office 365 CITSmart credentials to access the files. Throughout the procedure, it will also be necessary to access GIT. If you do not have access, request it to your manager.

## Procedure  

### Installing OS Ubuntu

 - Access the website https://ubuntu.com/#download to download Ubuntu. Click the first button to download the Desktop version. Always use the most recent version.  
  
 - After downloading the .iso file, you need to download Rufus https://rufus.ie/pt_BR/ too configure a bootable usb flashdrive.  
  
 - Besides Rufus and the .iso file, you will also need a flashdrive with at least 4gb of storage space.  
  
  
**To configure the drive, follow these steps:**  
  
  
 - Run Rufus.  
 
 - Insert the drive on the machine.
 
 - Rufus will update to show the device on the field _Device_.
 
 - Select the correct drive.  
       
!!! note "Note"  

         In order to avoid picking an incorrect device, make sure you have inserted only one device on your machine.
   
   
 - After selecting the device, pick the booting options. The options will be _Not Bootable_ and _FreeDOS_. Since you are creating a bootable device, pick _FreeDOS_.  
 
 - Leave the options for _Partition Scheme (MBR)_ and _Target system (BIOS (or UEFI-CSM))_ unchanged.  
 
 - Click the button _SELECT_ beside _Boot Selection_, look for the .iso file and click Open.  
 
 - The field _VOLUME LABEL_ will be updated to show the selected ISO.  
 
 - The other parameters should be left unchanged.  
 
 - Click _START_ to initiate the process.  
 
 - During the process, a message may show up warning that Rufus requires aditional files to conclude. Select Yes to proceed.  
 
 - During the process, you will be alerted that Rufus detected that the ISO is an image _ISOHybrid_. Keep the selected ISO image and click OK to proceed.  
 
 - Rufus will also warn you that all the data in the device are about to be destroyed. Verify if you selected the correct device before clicking OK.  
 
 - Wait for the conclusion of the process, which may take a few minutes depending on your machine. After the conclusion, click _CLOSE_ to close Rufus.  
       
 - Insert the drive with the ISO in your computer and restart the machine. Most computers will identify the bootable drive automatically and show you a welcome message, with options of language selection, install Ubuntu or try Ubuntu Desktop.  
   
!!! note "Nota"  
        
          If the computer does not automatically boot from the flashdrive, try holding f12 or Delete right when the computer is starting. Most machines will allow you to select the usb drive from a specific initialization menu. If this does not happen, verify the boot options and select the USB drive. If you are not certain, look for a brief message right when the computer is starting, which will show you the correct key to press to access the boot menu.  
          
 - Right after selecting your language, you will be asked to select the keyboard layout. If the installer does not detect the layout automatically, select _Detect keyboard layout_ to run a brief configuration procedure.  

 - After selecting Continue, you will be asked which aplications you wish to install. Select _Normal Installation_.  

 - Below the type of installation, there are two selection boxes; one to enable updates during instalation and another to enable third party software..  
  
 - Enable both options _Download updates_ and _Install third-party software._ 
   
 - For the next step, internet connection is necessary. If you are not connected, you will be asked to select a wireless network, if available. We advise you to connect during installation to ensure your machine is updated.  

 - The other options are _Localization_ and _Login details_.  

 - After everything is installed and configured, a small window will show asking you to restart your machine. Click _Restart Now_ and remove the flashdrive when asked.
