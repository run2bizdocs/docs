Title: Users Unlock Requirements

# Users Unlock Requirements

In this document we will see the necessary requirements to unlock a user.

## Before getting started

- [x]	The administrator must have enabled the User Blocking rule, contained in the Security Policy record;
- [x]	The user must be prevented from accessing the application due to the use of the user blocking rule.

## Procedure

From version Helium 1.2.24, new security rules have been added which led to the inclusion of this functionality.

1. Access the main menu System \> Security \> Blocked Users;

2. When accessing the functionality, a screen with the field will appear: User name - Text type field to search for the blocked users by name;

3. In addition to this field, a list will appear with the following information:

|List|Description|
|-----|---------|
|Blocked users|Displays the context/login information of the user who has been blocked|
|Blocking date|Displays the date/time information that the system performed the block|

4. Here, there is also the Delete action, which allows the removal of the user's immediate block.
