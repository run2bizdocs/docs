title: Register notification automatic action
Description: This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and deleting notification automatic actions.

# Register notification automatic action

This functionality allows the Manager to register notifications for automatic actions. The notification formalizes and communicates information about the event. It is important that the information about an event is described and completed to facilitate any further decision making. This registration is directly associated with the automatic actions and will be used in the 4biz event manager registration of Nagios, Zabbix, Inventory and Correlated Events.
Event notifications should only be sent to those responsible for handling related actions or decisions. This avoids unnecessary notifications to those who are not directly involved in the event process.
This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and deleting automatic action notifications.
