# Register automatic actions for the Incident / Request Management Process

Some events will present a situation in which the most appropriate action will be to handle them with the incident management process. This functionality is intended to register the automatic actions for the incident/request process. This registration will be associated with the automatic actions, where it will be used in the registration of 4biz event managers Nagios, Zabbix, Inventory and Correlated Event.

The event management supports the incident management process because it allows for the detection and prompt solution of early failures in a service, therefore avoiding service unavailability for the end user.
