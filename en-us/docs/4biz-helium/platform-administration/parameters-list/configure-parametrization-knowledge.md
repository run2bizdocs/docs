# Configure parametrization - knowledge


The service knowledge management system includes tools to collect, store,
manage, update, analyse and present all knowledge, information and data that an
IT service provider needs to manage the complete lifecycle of IT services.

The "Knowledge" parametrization must be performed to allow the execution/use of
this process, it may be possible to define the folder for storage of knowledge
created from events, define the directory to store the description of the
service request/incident response to be saved in the knowledge base, and other
actions.

Procedure
-------------

1.  Access the functionality through the main menu Parametrization \> Knowledge
    Management;

2.  Set the parameters values (attributes);

3.  Click on "Save";

4.  The list below presents the "Knowledge" parameters and the purpose of each
    one of them:
