# Configure parametrization - configuration

Configuration Management is the registration and detailed updating of
information that describes a company's hardware and software. It is a process to
establish and maintain the consistency of a product's performance, its
functional attributes, and other operational information throughout its life.

The configuration parametrization must be performed to allow the execution/use
of this process, it may be possible to define the group name for the
Configuration Items that do not have a group, to define the destination of the
sending notification emails that are close to expire the CI of type Software,
define the domain name of the network, among others.

Procedure
