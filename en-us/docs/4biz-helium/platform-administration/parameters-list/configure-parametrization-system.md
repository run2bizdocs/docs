title: Configure parametrization - system

# Configure parametrization - system


The "System" parametrization is used to change the characteristics about the
system authentication, inform the system URL, the several directories (GED, Log,
Temporaries), define the home screen, validate buttons permission (save, delete
and search), activate system log (audit), define the language preference and
others.

Procedure
-------------

1.  Access the functionality through the main menu Parametrization \> System;

2.  Define the parameters value (attributes);

3.  Click on "Save";

4.  The list below presents the "system" parameters and the purpose of each one
    of them:

Note: Currently the only way to use the electronic document management is internally.

The electronic document management files will be written to these folders.               |                                                              If the 'N' value for the Internal GED is informed, the files will not be saved correctly, will not be saved in the correct location and will not be encrypted.                                                              |
