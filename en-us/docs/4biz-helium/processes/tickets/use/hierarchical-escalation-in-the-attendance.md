Description: It's possible to escalate the attendance to another hierarchical level.

# Hierarchical escalation in the attendance

When working on any type of service, the attendant must first make sure that he/she will be able to attend it. If the ticket is outside his/her capabilities, 4biz offer the possibility to escalate it to another hierarchical level.

## Before getting started

To correctly escalate a ticket, it's necessary for the attendant to have the right permission in the group.

**Procedure**

1.	Access the functionality Ticket Management through the main menu Processes > Request and Incident Management > Service Request and Incident;

2.	Double click on the ticket;

3.	Choose to which group the ticket will be directed in the field "Direct to group".


## What to do next

You can verify in the Service Desk ticket list, if in the column "Current Group" the ticket was escalated to the right group.
