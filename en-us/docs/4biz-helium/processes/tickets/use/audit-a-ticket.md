# Audit a ticket
This functionality allows to audit the tickets created.

Before getting started
--------------------------

It's necessary to previously register the tickets and have access permission.

Procedure
-------------

1.  Access the functionality Ticket Management through the main menu Processes
    \> Ticket Management \> Ticket;

2.  Click on the first button located in the upper left side of the screen and then
    on "Audit";

3.  Complete the filters to audit the tickets you want;

4.  Click on the icon symbolized by a magnifying glass to define the filters
    necessary to verify the ticket instances history to audit.

!!! Abstract "ATTENTION"

    In the Ticket Management interface, specifically in the item "Auditing",
    when trying to configure the audit of an open ticket (define the start and
    end dates in the filter), the following error may occur: the system will
    display the "Invalid Date" message. This is because the functionality
    requires that the language set in the system and browser used be the same.

    If this requirement is not observed and this difference occurs in the
    languages, when auditing the tickets, the system will display a message and
    will not be able to receive the report you want.
