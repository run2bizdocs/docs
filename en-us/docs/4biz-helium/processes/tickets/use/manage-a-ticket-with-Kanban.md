Description: Allows to help managers in the detail monitoring of the tickets attendance list, using the management technique called Kanban

# Manage team with Kanban

This option allows the team managers to monitor the details of the tickets’ attendance with the help of a Kanban styled table of users and responsibilities. Kanban uses cards to indicate the attendance of production flows. In these cards, indications are given about a certain task, for example: "to execute" / "in execution" / "done", and whenever the flow advances its positioning changes to the right in the frame.

## Before getting started

It's necessary to have at least one ticket registered, in addition to have an access profile with the permission to access, execute and delegate tickets.

**Procedure**

1.	Access the functionality Ticket Management through the main menu Processes > Request and Incident Management > Service Request and Incident;

2.	Click on the ticket view in the Attendant mode, through the button "Per attendant";

3.	Filter the cards view;

4.	Manage the cards according to what’s needed.
