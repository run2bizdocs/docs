title: Approve a ticket
Description: In some cases, the tickes of type "Request" will pass through an approval phase to its execution. This will depend on the ticket workflow, which is linked to the service request activity 
# Approve a ticket  

When a ticket has an approval activity, you can confirm or 
reject this request using the feature for this purpose. In this 
sense, the ticket workflow should contain an user task (Identification 
tab \> Button "Is it an approval task? = YES"), which is linked to the activity.
