!!! Abstract "TIP"

    The "Description" field is the space for the ticket information to contain 
    words that refer directly to that service, being objective and easily associated 
    with the request theme. This content is linked to the "Keyword" field and to its 
    search return, which exists within the advanced search mode of a ticket. In addition, 
    it's possible to include attachments of various formats (eg.: .pdf, .doc, .png, .jpg 
    and others) to assist in the service process. The format limitation is set by the system 
    manager.

### Linking additional items

Access the small black button in the upper right side of the screen, below the menu bar, to view and interact with the desired functions.

**Project**;

**Schedule**;

### Saving request

At the end of the page, you will find a floating button with the functions of:

**Back** – to get back to the desktop of the Service Desk;

**Save** – to save the ticket and create the number for tracking and monitoring.


When creating the ticket for attendance, the user will see a new option (located at the top side of the screen) called *Layout*, this option allows the user to parametrize how the screen will be presented to the attendant, who can choose from the following possibilities:

**30X70** - The system divides the screen into two parts, the left side will show 30% of the screen and the right side 70%;

**50X50** - The system divides the screen into two parts, each side (right and left) will display 50% of the screen;

**100%** - The system presents the screen without division.


4.  Complete the other necessary data.



!!! note "NOTE"

    In this version of the functionality, on the right side of the screen, you will see the *Toogle*, which allows the side menus
    (formerly on the left side of the screen) to expand or reduce as needed.
