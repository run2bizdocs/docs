# Create escalation rule
This functionality allows to create escalation rules in order provide a perspective of impact to the company by managing the attendance of tickets (and its requests and incidents) within a pre-established adequate time. When creating rules for the notification of the responsible when the ticket is at critical level of rupture of its SLA, is possible to avoid this through preventive actions and escalate this service to other executor groups and thus respect their time of attendance.
This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and deleting the escalation rule.

Before getting started
--------------------------

To create escalation rules, it's necessary to set the parameter **190** with
value **Y**, and previously register the contracts, employees, groups, services
portfolios and the automatic action of escalation type.

In the file **citsmart.cfg**, it's necessary configure the
properties **START\_MONITORA\_INCIDENTES** informing the parameter TRUE
(only the operating system administrator of the application server makes this
adjustment).
