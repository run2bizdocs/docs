Description: 

# Register satisfaction survey

This feature provides a variety of actions, such as adding, changing, and deleting satisfaction surveys according to specific needs. The search form is created as a questionnaire.

The types of searches can be:

- **Public**: it allows for the participation of all users with no restrictions, they don't even need to be authenticated in the system. In this type, the System URL (parametrized) is given to the target to participate in the survey. It's only an outfit field (without typing). After the survey is created (saved), in this field, appears the full link, based on the System URL;

- **Global**: it restricts the participation of user authenticated in the system. It can be accessed in two ways:

    - When they identify themselves, they will receive an automatic notification (including steps to respond);

    - Within the Smart Portal (menu on the left side) in the option "Active Campaigns".

-   **Catalog**: it's intended for the evaluation, with the client, about the effectiveness of the catalog deployed;

-   **Service**: it's intended for the evaluation, with the client, about the effectiveness of a service deployed;

-   **Activity/Satisfaction**: another option of satisfaction survey from the client (beside the systemâ€™s default), about the resolution of an attendance of a request or incident.
