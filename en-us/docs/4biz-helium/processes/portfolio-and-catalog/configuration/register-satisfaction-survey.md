Description: 
# Register satisfaction survey

This feature provides a variety of actions, such as including, changing, and deleting satisfaction surveys according to the needs.
The search form is created as a questionnaire.

The types of searches can be:

-   **Public**: it allows the participation of all users with no restrictions,
    they don't even need to be authenticated in the system. In this type, the
    System URL (parametrized) is given to the target public to participate in
    the survey. It's only an outfit field (without typing). After the survey is
    created (saved), in this field, appears the full link, based on the System
    URL properly parametrized;

-   **Global**: it restricts the participation of user authenticated in the
    system. It can be accessed in two ways:

    -   when they identify themself, they will receive an automatic notification
        (including steps to respond);

    -   in the Smart Portal (menu on the left side) the option "Active
        Campaigns".

-   **Catalog**: it's intended for the evaluation, with the client, about the
    effectiveness of the catalog deployed;

-   **Service**: it's intended for evaluation, with the client, about the
    effectiveness of a service deployed;

-   **Activity/Satisfaction**: is another option of satisfaction survey, with
    the client (beside the system default), about the resolution of an
    attendance of a request or incident.
