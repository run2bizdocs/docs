### Designing a Service

The design phase of a Service is done through the **Services Pipeline** tab. Itâ€™ll present the services which are not ready for production yet. We have the following actions available:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
|New Service|To start creating a service for the Service Portfolio. For the fields to be completed, see the document [Register / Edit a service](/en-us/4biz-helium/processes/portfolio-and-catalog/use/register-a-service.html)|
|Service Name|To order the list of services in the pipeline by name|
|ASC|To order the list of services by ascending or descending|

!!! abstract "NOTE"

    The service will only advance to the service catalog phase when its Service Phase is set as "Chart" and the Service Status as "Production".
    
Still in the Services Pipeline tab, if you want to check the information of a service that is not live yet, you can pick one from the list available. For those services, we have the following actions:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Edit|To edit all the information for the creation of a service|
|Advance|To detail all the information about the service. For the fields available in the advance action, see the document [Register / Edit a service](/en-us/4biz-helium/processes/portfolio-and-catalog/use/register-a-service.html)|

### Service Catalog

In the **Services Catalog** tab, a list of the Services that are in production will be available. The same actions as in the service pipeline are available there:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Edit|To edit all the information of a service|
|Advance|To detail all the information about the service. For the fields available in the advance action, see the document [Register / Edit a service](/en-us/4biz-helium/processes/portfolio-and-catalog/use/register-a-service.html)|

### Obsolete Services

Finally, the **Obsolete Services** tab presents all services that are retired and those that are out of operation. It is used to maintain a history of all of the services that have gone through the pipeline and that are now deprecated. As in the other tabs, the list of Services and the following actions will be there:

|Action|Description|
|------|-----------|
|Edit|To edit all the information of a service|
|Advance|To detail all the information about the service. For the fields available in the advance action, see the document [Register / Edit a service](/en-us/4biz-helium/processes/portfolio-and-catalog/use/register-a-service.html)|
