Title: Setting service attribute
Description: At 4biz, service attributes are configured from the Service Portfolio.

# Setting service attribute

Every service has a set of attributes that characterize it and differentiate it
from others. The individual characteristics are varied and can be related to the
provision of the service, its relationship with different management processes,
its relationship with other services and with the parties involved in its
delivery or operation.

At 4biz, service attributes are configured from the Service Portfolio.

## Before getting started

- [x]   It's necessary to have previously configured the Service Pipeline.

## Procedure

To access the configuration screen for the attributes of a service, follow the
procedure below.

1.  Access the main menu Processes \> Portfolio and Catalog Management \>
    Portfolio.

2.  Find the Service Portfolio that has the service to be detailed and click on
    the "Advance".

3.  Find the service in the Service Portfolio list and click on the "Advance";

4.  On the left side of the screen are presented the different themes where the
    attributes that can be configured are grouped.

5.  Click on the theme of the attribute to be defined to access its
    configuration page.

>   Next, there are the service attribute themes available in 4biz.

## Service Attributes

**Details**

Theme related to the basic attributes of the service, such as Name, Status,
Criticality, Category, and others.

The tabs, form fields and actions available on this topic are described in the
documentÂ [Registering/Editing a service](https://docs.run2biz.com/en-us/4biz-helium/processes/portfolio-and-catalog/use/register-a-service.html).

### Service Level Requirements

This theme groups the attributes related to the service level management
process, such as the utility and guarantee of the service. The utility of the
service is its purpose for which it was created, and which customer needs it
intends to meet. The service guarantee is the conditions that determine that the
service is suitable for usage.

Clearly, service level requirements are related to the service level management
process. However, they can also be associated with other processes, such as
incident, problem and change management.

### Financial Attributes

These are the attributes that describe the relationship between the financial
management process and the service.

The financial attributes indicate the service's relationship with the Result
Centers, Departments and with the financial values of CAPEX, OPEX, Direct Value
and others.

This information can be used to present the current financial situation of a
service, as well as the entire history of cost and price variation.

The registration or changes in the financial information are performed within
the Financial Management process.

**Tip**

4biz differentiates between service cost and service price.

**Note**

4biz, using the hierarchical cost model, lists the registered financial items
and calculates the values corresponding to each service. This allows identifying
the cost distribution among the different registered services.

In addition, the values will be automatically linked to the corresponding
configuration item with the following information:

| Field          | Description                                                      |
