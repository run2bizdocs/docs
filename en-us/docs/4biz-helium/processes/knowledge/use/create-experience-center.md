# Creating experience center

The objective of the Experience Center (EC) is to provide a portal that users can customize according to their needs. When creating this portal, it's possible to customize the layout and the access references most appropriated to the client (as defined in the company's rules), and also to add videos from Youtube, Slideshows, and other apps, in order to ensure a more interactive and intuitive user experience. This feature provides a variety of actions, such as adding, changing, and deleting the Custom Experience Center.
