# Refine search in Knowledge Portal

This knowledge aims to guide and suggest the best ways to search for an article in the Knowledge Portal.

1.	Connectors between terms (Boolean logical operator):

        • AND (+): it's possible to search with more than one word, prioritizing one of them in the result. Adding the positive sign "+" in front of the word, it'll be prioritized, for example: ticket +delegate;

        • NOT (-): it's possible to refine (reduce) the result, including words to be excluded from the list. E.g.: Request -Incident.

2.	Try with different variations of a word, for example:
        • Request

        • Requesting

        • It's possible to search for a part of the word: Reque

3.	Use synonyms:

        • Generate

        • Create

4.	Use commas to search for exact phrases:

        • Put the phrase you want with commas, e.g.: "How to delegate a ticket"

5.	Navigate through the folders and click in one with the subject you want.
