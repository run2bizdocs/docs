# Overview  

Presentation
----------------

Change Management is the process responsible to evaluate, coordinate and
decide about making change proposals to Configuration Items (CI). According  
to ITIL, the main goal of this process is ensure that changes are made in a
controlled way, and being evaluated, prioritized, planned, tested, implanted
and documented.

Changes can be categorized as: Standard Change, Normal Change and Emergency
Change.

-   **Standard Change**:authorized of low risk, it occurs with frequency.
    It's initiated by a defined trigger that follows a procedure or work instruction
    to make the activities - well known - have a pre-determined budget. E.g.: Install
    a standard *desktop* application package..

-   **Normal Change**: any change in services other than emergency or standard.
    It follows the policies, deadlines and procedures defined by the organization.

-   **Emergency Change**: changes that need to be done as soon as possible.
    E.g.: Change to resolve a Major Incident or implement a security fix.
    The Change Management process usually has a specific procedure to handle 
    emergency changes.
