3.  To register a new window of change, click on the date you want;

4.  Complete the necessary fields (title, type, start and end date/time,
    description of change, recurrence of window of change).
    There are two types of change window:

    -   Manintenance: used to establish periods of time that changes in the
    CI will occur;

    -   Blackout: used to establish periods of time that changes in the CI
    won't occur.
