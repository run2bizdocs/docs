Description: This functionality is intended to plan the activities to be deployed to the release. 
# Activities of the deployment release phase

This functionallity allows to plan the activities to be implemented along the release, 
similar to what occurs in the Release Planning phase.

Before getting started
--------------------

Before performing the activities inherent to the Release Deployment, there must 
be a Release with the planning phase completed.


Procedure
-------------

1.  Access the functionality through the main menu Processes \> Release
    Management \> Release;

2.  Find the release request you want to Plan the activity, click on the
    button “Open” and then on the area "Deployment Release";

3.  We can create a Kanban to manage the activities registered. Click on "+
    Workspace" (available in the area called "Activities") and complete the data
    available, for example, the title, its phase (to be done, in progress,
    etc.), select the user or group responsible for the execution of tasks and
    others;
    
    !!! Abstract "NOTE"
    
        When linking an existing Kanban, if the user does not have permission to 
        access a particular Workspace, the system will display a message informing 
        it. The user must then request permission in Workspace and Sprint or create 
        a new Kanban framework.

4.  You can link the roles and responsibilities, projects, documents, notes and
    notifications of system to the release. To do so, it's necessary to
    click on the available frame, select the item to link it to the release;

5.  In addition to allowing the link of responsibilities, projects, and
    notification of systems, it's possible to create from scratch to fit the
    release in thesis, by clicking on the "Register" button and complete the
    required fields.

What to do next
-------------------

It's possible to link other functionalities to the release.
